Throwing Shapes was designed and developed by Siobhán Schnittger as a student of National College of Ireland (NCI), Mayor Square, Dublin 1. The images, graphics and t-shirt design are the exclusive property of Siobhán Schnittger and Throwing Shapes. The code and implementation are the property of Siobhan Schnittger and NCI. I would like to thank the faculty and staff at NCI for their time, guidance and facilities as well as Throwing Shapes for allowing me to use the business as a template. Throwing shapes tees are available for purchase at www.throwingshapes.ie.
